# How I Reduced S3 Pricing by Compressing Images into WebP and Optimized Frontend Load Time

When hosting images on AWS S3, costs can quickly add up due to storage and bandwidth usage. To optimize both costs and performance, I implemented WebP image compression on the frontend before uploading files to S3. This approach significantly reduced image sizes, leading to lower storage costs and faster load times for users.

## Why WebP?

WebP is a modern image format that provides better compression than JPEG and PNG without compromising image quality. By converting images to WebP before uploading them to S3, I achieved:

- **Reduced storage costs**: WebP images are smaller in size, meaning less data stored in S3.
- **Faster page load times**: Smaller images lead to quicker downloads, improving the user experience.
- **Lower data transfer costs**: Since WebP images are compressed efficiently, less data is transferred when loading images from S3.

## Image Compression with WebP in the Browser

To handle image compression on the frontend, I used the `canvas` API to convert uploaded images to WebP format before sending them to S3. Hereâ€™s the function I implemented:

```typescript
export const convertImagesWebP = async (files: File[]): Promise<File[]> => {
  const convertedFiles = await Promise.all(
    files.map(async (file) => {
      // Create canvas and load image
      const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
      const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
      const img = new Image();

      // Convert to WebP using canvas
      return new Promise((resolve) => {
        img.onload = () => {
          canvas.width = img.width;
          canvas.height = img.height;
          ctx?.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
          canvas.toBlob((blob) => {
            if (blob) {
              resolve(
                new File([blob], file.name.replace(/\.[^/.]+$/, ".webp"), {
                  type: "image/webp",
                })
              );
            }
          }, "image/webp");
        };
        img.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
      });
    })
  );
  return convertedFiles as File[];
};
```

### How It Works:

1. The function accepts an array of `File` objects (uploaded images).
2. It creates an `Image` element to load each file.
3. A `canvas` is used to draw the image and convert it to WebP format.
4. The converted image is returned as a new `File` object with a `.webp` extension.

I'm using Next.js for the frontend and AWS Lambda functions as the API

Im converting images on frontend side to remove extra heavy load from aws lambda here what its look like:

```
<input
  id="image"
  name="image"
  accept="image/*"
  type="file"
  multiple={true}
  className="block w-full rounded-md bg-white px-3 py-1.5 text-base text-gray-900 outline-1 -outline-offset-1 outline-gray-300 placeholder:text-gray-400 focus:outline-2 focus:-outline-offset-2 focus:outline-indigo-600 sm:text-sm/6"
  onChange={async (
    e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>
  ) => {
    const files = await convertImagesWebP(
      Array.from(e.target.files || [])
    );
    setSelectedImages(files);
  }}
/>
```

In lambda side creating presignedUrls for each image name and returning to frontend as this

```
const presignedUrls = await Promise.all(
    images.map(async (imageName: string) => {
        const command = new PutObjectCommand({
            Bucket: BUCKET_NAME,
            Key: `${tenantId}/${product.id}/${imageName}`,
            ContentType: 'image/*',
        })
        const presignedUrl = await getSignedUrl(s3Client, command, { expiresIn: 3600 })
        return presignedUrl
    }),
)

```

In the end, I'm uploading to S3 like this on the frontend:

```
await Promise.all(
        responce.presignedUrls.map(async (presignedUrl, index) => {
          const imageFile = selectedImages[index];
          await axios.put(presignedUrl, imageFile, {
            headers: {
              "Content-Type": imageFile.type,
            },
          });
        })
      );
```

## Uploading to S3

After converting the images to WebP, they can be uploaded to S3 using pre-signed URLs or an API endpoint. Since WebP images are smaller, this reduces the amount of data stored in S3 and decreases egress costs when images are accessed by users.

## Results and Benefits

After implementing this solution, I observed:

- **Up to 50% reduction in S3 storage costs**.
- **Significantly improved website load times** due to smaller image sizes.
- **Lower CDN and bandwidth costs** when serving images to users.

By optimizing image storage and delivery with WebP, I not only reduced operational expenses but also enhanced the user experience. If you're using S3 for image hosting, I highly recommend compressing images into WebP before uploading!
